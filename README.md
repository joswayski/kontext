# Kontext

I want to build a tool that visualizes the event flows in my Kafka clusters and gives me **Kontext** on what the consumers *DO* with the data (business logic). 

This project is in the early stages of development, contributions are welcome!


## Getting Started

```bash
cp .env.example .env

docker compose up -d --build
```

This will start the API on port 4000 and the web app on port 3000.
